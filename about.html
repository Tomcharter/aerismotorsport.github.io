        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Aeris Motorsport was founded in 2023 by a small group of sim racing enthusiasts who shared a common goal: to compete at the highest level of iRacing while building a community that's welcoming, competitive, and fun.</p>
        <p>What started as a few friends racing together in public lobbies quickly evolved into an organised team effort. Within our first year, we secured our debut championship win — and we haven't looked back since.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <p>From humble beginnings to championship contenders, Aeris Motorsport represents the best of sim racing — fierce competition, clean racing, and camaraderie.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p><strong>Clean Racing</strong> — We race hard but fair. Respect on track is non-negotiable. Our drivers are known for their wheel-to-wheel battles that leave both parties with their cars intact.</p>
        <p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong> — Every race is a learning opportunity. We debrief, analyse data, review replays, and constantly refine our craft. Getting faster is a team effort.</p>
        <p><strong>Community</strong> — We believe sim racing is better together. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer finding your feet, there's a place for you in the Aeris family.</p>
        <p><strong>Passion</strong> — We do this because we love it. The thrill of a last-lap overtake, the satisfaction of a perfectly executed pit strategy, the buzz of climbing the championship standings — that's what Aeris is all about.</p>

        <h2>What is iRacing?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.iracing.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iRacing</a> is the world's premier online motorsport simulation. Used by real-world professional drivers for training, iRacing offers laser-scanned tracks, meticulously modelled cars, and a sophisticated matchmaking system that ensures fair, competitive racing.</p>
        <p>Races run on a fixed schedule — just like real motorsport — with seasons, championships, and official standings. It's as close to real racing as you can get without leaving your desk.</p>
